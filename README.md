## Running the player

The index.html file can be run on any modern browser to run the music player.

## Adding more tracks

The tracks are currently being loaded from the tracklist array specified in main.js. More tracks can be added by adding the details of each track as an object to the tracklist.

## Add more tracks to playlist

More tracks can be added by adding a new div class="track-number  in index.html.
Make sure that the number ' ' is always one less than in playlist details : 1 = 0, 2 = 1 etc.
